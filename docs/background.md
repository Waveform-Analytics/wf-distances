# Background info

This dashboard provides an example of how dense, tabular results from a complex simulation can be presented in a way that makes it easier to interpret. You can quickly see the relationships between different variables, and hover over data points to get a fuller picture of what's going on. 

While the data presented in this dashboard were fabricated for demonstration purposes, they are based on the type of data presented in permit applications for offshore wind construction projects (e.g., [Take authorizations for renewables/LNG](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/marine-mammal-protection/incidental-take-authorizations-other-energy-activities-renewable)). 

If you'd like to take a look at the underlying code, please visit the [github repository](https://github.com/Waveform-Analytics/wf-distances). This dashboard was created by [Waveform Analytics, LLC](https://waveformanalytics.com).
